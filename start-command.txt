To add the start and dev commands, add these to your package.json scripts section:

"start": "node start.js",
"dev": "concurrently \"vite\" \"nodemon server.js\"",

You can do this by running:
npm pkg set scripts.start="node start.js"
npm pkg set scripts.dev="concurrently \"vite\" \"nodemon server.js\""

You should also install these development dependencies:
npm install -D concurrently nodemon

For production:
1. Build your app with "npm run build"
2. Run "npm start" to start your self-hosted Lynxier app

For development:
1. Run "npm run dev" to start both frontend and backend in development mode with hot reloading
